## Short Description
Efficiency is the key to our problem. With that in mind, we have came up with “OverWatch”. It is a life-saving smart watch specifically catered to the elderly, which collects data such as heart rate and acceleration to detect various emergencies. In the event of an emergency, the watch will then alert SCDF and trigger an event in the MyResponder app, allowing for swift and immediate actions to be taken by the CFRs to assess and relieve the situation, while SCDF prepares to deploy help.
